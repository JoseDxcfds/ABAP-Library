# ABAP Library

This repository represents my personal reusable ABAP code library. Feel free to use or contribute!

Files reside in clean sub-folders for the sake of organization.

Many classes here also represent sample implementations of [ABAP design patterns](https://www.sap-press.com/design-patterns-in-abap-objects_4277/).

None of those files include any company-specific functional logic - so there are no "trade secrets" revealed.
